## Overview

**Speculators** is a unified library for creating, representing, and storing speculative decoding algorithms for large language model (LLM) serving, such as in vLLM. It provides a standard format and tools to facilitate the productization of decoding algorithms for inference servers.

### Key Features

- **Speculative Decoding:** Simplify the creation and representation of speculative decoding algorithms for LLMs.
- **Standardized Format:** Ensure compatibility and ease of use with a standardized format for decoding algorithms.
- **Integration Ready:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with LLM inference servers like vLLM.
- **Productization Tools:** Streamline the process of deploying decoding algorithms in production environments.

## Getting Started
